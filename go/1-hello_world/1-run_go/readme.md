# Run Go
In attached `code.go` file, you:

- Declare a main package (a package is a way to group functions, and it's made up of all the files in the same directory).
- Import the popular fmt package, which contains functions for formatting text, including printing to the console. This package is one of the standard library packages you got when you installed Go.
- Implement a main function to print a message to the console. A main function executes by default when you run the main package.

Run your code to see the greeting.
```bash
go run .
```

The go run command is one of many go commands you'll use to get things done with Go. Use the following command to get a list of the others:
```bash
go help
```
